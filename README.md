Block 9: Unit 1 Career Simulation: Personal Website Pt I


Create a personal site with a brief bio. It is a chance to show off who you are, what you are about, and what you have accomplished. We will focus on three main areas: the landing page, an about page, and a portfolio page.

You will get the chance to revisit this project as we learn new techniques, so do not worry about perfecting it during your first pass. The goal here is to practice writing semantic HTML, basic CSS, and Javascript. You must use a GitHub repository.


Should Include:

1. Home Page

About Page

Portfolio Page


2. In a GitHub repository include more than one branch 

(including main/master) with descriptive branch names.

Have more than one commit with descriptive commit messages.

3. Include a descriptive Readme file.

4. Create five functional files: 
index.html, 
about.html, 
portfolio.html, 
style.css, and 
javascript.js.


5. GitHub repository, with:

More than one branch (including main/master), with descriptive branch name(s)
More than one commit, with descriptive commit messages

6. A descriptive Readme file

7. A functional website that fulfills the requirements, and includes:
three pages: home, about, work/portfolio

8. A persistent header with links

9. Personalized content, including both formatted text and images

10. Basic CSS styling, included via an external file
